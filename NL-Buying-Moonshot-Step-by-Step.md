# Guide to buying MOONSHOT

This manual has been written with the purpose of explaining step by step how to buy and sell Moonshot via **Binance** , **MetaMask** &amp; **PancakeSwap**** via your mobile**. Moonshot is a crypto coin, released on March 29th 2021. There are many great developments on the agenda this year and the potential growth is gigantic. When you buy and hold Moonshot, you will automatically receive more Moonshot with every transaction made. This means: With every purchase and sale of Moonshot, you receive more coins. More information about Moonshot can be found at:
[**https://project-moonshot.me/**](https://project-moonshot.me/). You are also very welcome to join the Telegram group: [**https://t.me/MoonShotChat**](https://t.me/MoonShotChat). There are a lot of helpful people who are eager to meet you.

To buy and sell Moonshot you will roughly have to take the following route:

**To buy it:** Bank -\&gt; Binance -\&gt; MetaMask -\&gt; PancakeSwap

**To sell it:** PancakeSwap -\&gt; MetaMask -\&gt; Binance -\&gt; Bank

You will need the digital currency BNB to buy Moonshot. Given all the fees that you have to pay, I recommend investing a minimum amount of â‚¬ 100. You can buy BNB with Euros and with BNB you buy Moonshot.

I will try to explain everything as completely as possible, but you will have to carefully check what kind of information is being given in a number of steps. Obviously I take no responsibility for any errors that may arise that result in loss of data or money. This step by step manual has a purely informative purpose to guide you as easily as possible in the purchase and sale of Moonshot. I won&#39;t go through all the steps around the complete security of your Binance account, purely information regarding the requirements for buying and selling cryptocurrency on Binance. I do advise you to find out for yourself on how you can optimize security at a somewhat later stage. For now, these steps should be enough.

 I also advise you to learn more about investing, in crypto and all the pros and cons around it. Never spend more money than you can afford to lose! Assume that you can lose everything you invest. Think of a good strategy and keep your emotions in check ðŸ˜‰ In general, you will make more profit by holding your position for a longer time than if you try to sell at a high point and buy back a low point.

 Keep the following items at hand:

- **Passport** , **ID** or **Driver&#39;s**** license**
- **Debit card**
- **Phone**
- **Pen &amp; paper**
  - Write down all your passwords and important information. Then keep the paper in a physically safe place and **don&#39;t forget where you put it!** I will markthe information which needs to be written down.

You will receive multiple emails and texts during registration and securing your account. This will also occur for the transfer of amounts and coins. Follow the steps described in your screen.
